# Information
This datapack add all the recipes necessary to be able to grow all the seeds from
[Thermal Cultivation](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-cultivation)
using the Immersive Engineering Garden Cloche.

I've made it based on Thermal's Insolator recipes. The base time for crops to
grow should be 800 ticks, and some have an `energy_mod` attribute I applied on
that base time. The output is also the same but without the additionnal drop chance
(I've floored the `chance` attribute to get the output `count` of the new recipe).
Spores/mushrooms can only be grown on mycelium and podzol like the vanilla mushrooms.

# Note
This datapack requires
[Immersive Engineering](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-engineering) and
